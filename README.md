q-gram matching is used for approximate substring matching problems in a wide range of application areas, including
intrusion detection. This project is the implementation of concept presented in paper "q-Gram Matching Using Tree Models by
Prahlad Fogla and Wenke Lee". A tree-based model to perform fast linear time q-gram matching is presented. All q-grams present in the
text are stored in a tree structure similar to Trie.A tree redundancy pruning algorithm to reduce the size of the tree without
losing any information is used. It also uses suffix links for fast q-gram search during query matching.
